% This sample file mainly explains the functionality of the Control System 
% Toolbox (CST). This toolbox is mainly used in control engineering tasks. 
% Starting point for the use of the CST is a mathematical model of the 
% considered system. In general, only linear time-continuous and time-discrete 
% problems are considered.

% Creating data objects in the CST
% A simple PT2 element is considered

T = 0.5;
xi = 0.2;
V = 2;

% 1st possibility: transfer function

G_tf = tf([V],[T^2 2*xi*T 1])

% Access to the data object

G_tf.num{1}   % ZÃ¤hler
G_tf.den{1}   % Denominator
G_tf.Variable % Variable

% Alternative (to be used preferably)

s = tf('s')   % Creating the complex variables s
G_tf1 = V/(1+2*xi*T*s+s^2*T^2)


% 2nd possibility: via pole zero representation

p1 = (-xi+sqrt(xi^2-1))/T;
p2 = (-xi-sqrt(xi^2-1))/T;
G_zp = zpk([],[p1 p2],V/T^2)

% Access to the data object

G_zp.z{1}   % Zeros
G_zp.p{1}   % Poles
G_zp.k      % Poles
G_zp.Variable % Variable


% 3rd possibility: state space representation

A = [0 1; -1/T^2 -2*xi/T];
B = [0;V/T^2];
C = [1;0];
D = 0;

sys = ss(A,B,C',D)


% Access to the data object

sys.a   % Dynamics matrix
sys.b   % Input matrix
sys.c   % Output matrix
sys.d   % Feed-through matrix
sys.StateName % Name of the states


% 4th possibility: Numerical input of measured transfer functions, 
% not discussed here

% Convert objects to other display formats

G_ss2tf = tf(sys)
G_spk2tf = tf(G_zp)

sys_zpk2ss = ss(G_zp)
sys_tf2ss = ss(G_tf)

G_ss2zpk = zpk(sys)
G_tf2zpk = zpk(G_tf)

% Additional possibilities

help ss2zp
help zp2tf
help zp2ss
help tf2zp

% Discrete models
% These can basically be generated as before, but a sampling time must be 
% specified

Ta = 0.2; % Specification of a sampling time

% Direct creation

z = tf('z',Ta)
Gzt = 1/(z-0.5);    % As transfer function
sysd = ss(1,1,1,0,Ta) % As State-Space (here: discrete integrator)         

% From existing continuous model

Gz = c2d(G_tf,Ta,'zoh')    % A zero-order hold element is used here
sys_z = c2d(sys,Ta,'zoh')

% Models in the Tustin domain (q domain, bilinear transform)

Gq = d2c(Gz,'tustin')
sys_q = d2c(sys_z,'tustin')
%%

% Models with delay times

G_tzi = tf(1,[1 1],'inputdelay',0.5)   % Input delay
G_tzo = tf(1,[1 1],'outputdelay',0.5)  % Output delay
G_tzio = tf(1,[1 1],'iodelay',0.5)     % Input output delay


%%

% Linking of models
G2 = 1/s;

Gsum = G_tf+G2    % Sum of the models
Gdiff = G_tf-G2   % Difference of the models
Gprod = G_tf*G2   % Series connection of the models
Gfb = feedback(G_tf,G2) % Feedback

% Analysis of LTI models

dcgain(G_tf)    % Determine amplification factor
damp(G_tf)      % Natural frequencies and damping
bandwidth(G_tf) % bandwidth

pole(G_tf)      % Poles of the transfer function
zero(G_tf)      % Zeros of the transfer function
